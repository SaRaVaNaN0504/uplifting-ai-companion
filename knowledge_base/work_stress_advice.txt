To manage work stress effectively, it is crucial to establish clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. This can be achieved by setting a specific time each evening to completely disconnect from work-related communications, such as emails and messages. Creating an "end-of-workday" ritual, like taking a walk or changing clothes, can signal to your brain that it is time to switch off and rest.

Another key strategy is to break down overwhelming tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. When you're feeling stressed by a large project, take a moment to write down the single next action you can take. You don't have to solve the entire problem at once. Focusing on one small, achievable goal can make the situation feel less daunting and restore a sense of control.
