Managing study stress starts with breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. When you feel overwhelmed, try writing down everything you need to do, then prioritize the most important or time-sensitive tasks. Set realistic goals for each study session and take regular short breaks — for example, study for 25 minutes, then rest for 5. This helps keep your mind fresh and focused.

It's also essential to care for your physical and emotional health during stressful study periods. Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and eating balanced meals. Mindfulness techniques, such as taking a few minutes to focus on your breathing or doing light stretches, can help reduce tension. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help — reach out to teachers, classmates, or a counselor if you’re struggling to cope.
