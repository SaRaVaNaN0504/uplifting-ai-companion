Feeling tired and exhausted is a signal from your body that it needs to rest and recover. One of the best things you can do is to check your sleep hygiene. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends. Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid screens like phones or TVs for at least an hour before bed, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep cycle.

Also, consider your energy levels throughout the day. While it seems counterintuitive, light physical activity like a 15-minute walk can actually boost your energy more than sitting still. Pay attention to your diet as well; staying hydrated and eating balanced meals can prevent energy crashes.
