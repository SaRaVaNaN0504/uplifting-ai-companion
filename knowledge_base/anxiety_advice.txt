One of the most effective techniques for managing anxiety in the moment is grounding. This involves bringing your awareness to the present moment through your senses. A popular method is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This pulls your mind away from anxious thought loops and back into your physical environment.

Deep, diaphragmatic breathing is another powerful tool. When you are anxious, your breathing often becomes shallow and rapid. Consciously slowing it down can send a signal to your nervous system to calm down. Try the 4-7-8 method: inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeating this a few times can significantly lower your heart rate and reduce feelings of panic.
