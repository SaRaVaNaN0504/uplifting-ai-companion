## ðŸ“– About The Project

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The Uplifting AI Companion is a web-based conversational AI designed to provide a safe, empathetic, and supportive space for users. It addresses the need for immediate, accessible first-line emotional support for individuals experiencing stress, sadness, loneliness, or burnout.

Unlike typical chatbots, this project leverages a hybrid logic architecture that can intelligently choose between dynamic advice and heartfelt empathy â€” all tailored to the user's intent.

### ðŸ”¹ Path 1: The Advice Seeker (RAG / LLM System)

- Triggered when a user asks a question (e.g., "how to stop overthinking?")
- Combines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using:
  - A curated knowledge base in .txt files
  - ChromaDB vector search
  - Hugging Face sentence-transformers
  - Groqâ€™s Llama 3 for detailed, intelligent replies

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Triggered when a user expresses a feeling (e.g., "I feel so sad.")
- Follows a 2-step empathy flow:
  1. A probing question to understand emotional context
  2. A validating response that reflects the userâ€™s input

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running on your machine.

#### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ installed.
*   An active Python virtual environment (recommended).
*   A free API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).

#### Installation & Setup

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1.  Clone the Repository
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    

2.  Install Dependencies
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3.  Set Up Environment Variables
    Create a file named .env in the root of the project and add your Groq API key:
    
    GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourActualGroqApiKeyHere"
    

4.  Create Your Knowledge Base
    Create a folder named knowledge_base/ in the root directory. Inside it, add your advice as .txt files. The filenames are important and should correspond to the chatbot's conversational flows (e.g., anxiety_advice.txt, work_stress_advice.txt).
=======
1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Groq API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourActualGroqApiKeyHere"
    ```

4.  **Create Your Knowledge Base**
    Create a folder named `knowledge_base/` in the root directory. Inside it, add your advice as `.txt` files. The filenames are important and should correspond to the chatbot's conversational flows (e.g., `anxiety_advice.txt`, `work_stress_advice.txt`).

    â”œâ”€â”€ study_stress_advice.txt
    â””â”€â”€ loneliness_advice.txt
    

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
5.  Build the Vector Database
    Run this script once to process your knowledge base files. It only needs to be re-run if you add or change the .txt files.

### Live Demo & Testing

Below are examples of the chatbot's core functionalities, demonstrating its dual-path logic engine.

#### Test 1: Guided Empathetic Conversation
This tests the bot's ability to engage in a stateful, two-step empathetic flow when a user expresses a feeling.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
*   User Input: i feel so tired today
*   Bot's Probe Question: That feeling of being completely drained is so hard to push through. Is this more of a physical tiredness or a mental exhaustion, Alexa?
*   User's Reply: i just didn't get enough sleep
*   Bot's Final Response: I hear you. Your body and mind are telling you they need rest. Please listen to them and be gentle with yourself today. Rest is productive.

#### Test 2: Intelligent Advice (RAG System)
This tests the bot's ability to answer a direct question for help using its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
*   User Input: how can I overcome stress from my job?
*   Expected Bot Behavior: The bot will provide a detailed, conversational answer generated by the LLM, based on the content of your work_stress_advice.txt file.

#### Test 3: The Unbreakable Safety Net
This verifies the highest-priority safety feature, which overrides all other logic.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
*   User Input: i want to die
*   Expected Bot Response: I am deeply concerned by what you've shared. Your safety and wellbeing are the most important things right now. Please reach out to someone who can help immediately: ðŸ†˜ National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US) ðŸ†˜ Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

### Project Limitations

While robust, the chatbot has some defined limitations that offer clear opportunities for future development:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
*   Session-Based Memory: The bot only remembers the user's name within a single browser session. It does not have long-term memory to recall past conversations.
*   Keyword-Based Initial Triage: The initial routing to the "Advice" or "Empathy" path is based on a list of keywords. This is reliable but less nuanced than a machine learning classifier could be.
*   No Proactive Engagement: The bot is purely reactive and will not initiate a conversation or send follow-up notifications.
*   Not a Medical Device: The chatbot is explicitly a supportive companion and not a substitute for professional medical or therapeutic help. It is designed to de-escalate and point users toward professional resources in a crisis.
